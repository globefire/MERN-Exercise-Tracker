use npx create-react-app projectName to create app without installing react first

-------------List of commands I used after the above line:---------------------
- created a backend folder in react app
- npm install express cors mangoose dotenv
- npm install -g nodemon


--------------About the packages-----------------------
- Express : A lightweight framework  of node.js
- cors(Cross Origin resource Sharing) : allows ajax requests to skip same origin policy & access resource from remote hosts
- Mongoose : makes interaction with MongoDB through node.js simpler
- dotenv : loads environment variable, instead of setting environment variables on sys they can be stored in a file
- nodemon : refreshes the application when files are changed

Inside the models folder of backend we have defined the data structure of users and exercises.
Inside the routes folder of backend we are using an API to help the server perform CRUD operations.
